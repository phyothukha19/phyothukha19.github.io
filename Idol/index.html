    <h3>Personal information</h3>
    <span>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around US$243 billion as of February 2022,[2] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires list.[3][4]

        Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
        
        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
        
        Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized controversial statements. In 2018, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreed to limitations on his Twitter usage. In 2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. Musk has also been criticized for spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public transport.</span>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Early life and Career</h1>
        <br>
        <span>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[5] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[6][7][8] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once a half owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[9][10] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[8][11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[12][13] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[14][15] The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".[10][16] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[14] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[17] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[17] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[12][18] Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.[19]

            Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[20][21] He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[22][23] An awkward and introverted child,[24] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[17][25] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[26]</span>
            <br>
            <h1>wealth</h1>
            <br>
            <span>Musk made $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002.[238] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[239]

                At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[240] By the year's end his net worth had increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[241] During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[242] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[243] In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[244] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[245] On September 27, 2021, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world, after Tesla stock surged.[246] In November 2021, Musk became the first person with a net worth over $300 billion.[247]
                
                Around three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla.[243] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018 to a compensation plan with the board that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[241] The deal stipulated that Musk only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values.[248] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board.[249] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[249][248]
                
                Musk has repeatedly described himself as "cash poor",[250][251] and has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".[250] In 2012, Musk signed The Giving Pledge and, in May 2020, Musk pledged to "sell almost all physical possessions".[251][252] In 2021, Musk defended his wealth by saying he is "accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary [and] extend the light of consciousness to the stars".[253] In the early 2000s, Musk was a private pilot, his favorite aircraft then being the L-39 Albatros, though he decided to stop piloting by 2008.[254][255] He uses a private jet owned by SpaceX[256][257] and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[258] The jet's heavy use of fossil fuels—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—has received criticism.[256][259] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[260]</span>

   <h1 id="company">Companies</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Xcom and PayPal</h1>
    <br>
   <span>In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[52] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[53] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[54] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.[42][54][55] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[56] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.[50][57] Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[58] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[59][note 2] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[61][62] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received over $100 million.[63][64]

    In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.[65][66]</span>
    <br>
    <h1>SpaceX</h1>
    <span>In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.[67] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Mike Griffin to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[68] With $100 million of his early fortune,[69] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.[70] As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer.[71]

        SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006,[72] and although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA later that year.[73] After two more failed attempts, which reportedly caused Musk so much stress that he was "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain,"[74] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008, making it the first private liquid-fuel rocket to do so.[75] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[76] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[77] Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.[78] Landings were later achieved on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform.[79] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[80][81] In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket, later renamed to Starship, which would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities.[82] In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called dearMoon project.[83] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[84]
        
        SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[85] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[86] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[87][note 3]
        
        The company has attracted criticism from astronomers who say Starlink's satellites are blocking the view of the skies, and from experts arguing that they risk colliding and causing dangers in space.[90][91] Musk rejected the criticism, stating that the impact of satellites is "nothing" and that "space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny."[90]</span>
        <br>
       <h1>Tesla</h1>
        <br>
        <span>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[92] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[93] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[94][95] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[96] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[97][98] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[99] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[100][101] As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[102] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his position as CEO.[103]

            Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[104] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012;[105] a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[106][107] A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[108][109] As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered.[110] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[111] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[112] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.[113][114][115]
            
            
            Musk at the 2019 Tesla annual shareholder meeting
            Since its initial public offering in 2010,[116] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[117][118] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[119][120] In October 2021 it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.[121] On November 6, 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter selling 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".[122][123] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock in the week ending November 12,[122] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[124]
            
            SEC lawsuit
            In September 2018, Musk was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)[125] for a tweet claiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[126][note 4] The lawsuit claimed that discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[126][130][131] Musk called the allegations unjustified and claimed he had never compromised his integrity.[132] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[133][134]
            
            Musk has stated in interviews he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[135][136] On February 19, 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[137] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[138] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[139] In May 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the agreement.[140][141] FOIA released records showing that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price".[142]</span>
