    <h1>Xcom and PayPal</h1>
    <br>
   <span>In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[52] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[53] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[54] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.[42][54][55] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[56] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.[50][57] Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[58] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[59][note 2] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[61][62] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received over $100 million.[63][64]

    In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.[65][66]</span>

    <h1>SpaceX</h1>
    <span>In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.[67] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Mike Griffin to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[68] With $100 million of his early fortune,[69] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.[70] As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer.[71]

        SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006,[72] and although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA later that year.[73] After two more failed attempts, which reportedly caused Musk so much stress that he was "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain,"[74] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008, making it the first private liquid-fuel rocket to do so.[75] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[76] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[77] Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.[78] Landings were later achieved on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform.[79] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[80][81] In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket, later renamed to Starship, which would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities.[82] In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called dearMoon project.[83] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[84]
        
        SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[85] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[86] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[87][note 3]
        
        The company has attracted criticism from astronomers who say Starlink's satellites are blocking the view of the skies, and from experts arguing that they risk colliding and causing dangers in space.[90][91] Musk rejected the criticism, stating that the impact of satellites is "nothing" and that "space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny."[90]</span>

       <h1>Tesla</h1>
        <br>
        <span>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[92] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[93] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[94][95] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[96] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[97][98] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[99] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[100][101] As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[102] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his position as CEO.[103]

            Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[104] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012;[105] a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[106][107] A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[108][109] As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered.[110] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[111] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[112] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.[113][114][115]
            
            
            Musk at the 2019 Tesla annual shareholder meeting
            Since its initial public offering in 2010,[116] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[117][118] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[119][120] In October 2021 it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.[121] On November 6, 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter selling 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".[122][123] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock in the week ending November 12,[122] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[124]
            
            SEC lawsuit
            In September 2018, Musk was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)[125] for a tweet claiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[126][note 4] The lawsuit claimed that discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[126][130][131] Musk called the allegations unjustified and claimed he had never compromised his integrity.[132] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[133][134]
            
            Musk has stated in interviews he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[135][136] On February 19, 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[137] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[138] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[139] In May 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the agreement.[140][141] FOIA released records showing that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price".[142]</span>
