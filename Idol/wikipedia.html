    <h1>Personal information</h1>
    <span>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around US$243 billion as of February 2022,[2] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires list.[3][4]

        Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
        
        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
        
        Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized controversial statements. In 2018, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreed to limitations on his Twitter usage. In 2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. Musk has also been criticized for spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public transport.</span>

        <h1>Early life and Career</h1>
        <br>
        <span>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[5] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[6][7][8] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once a half owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[9][10] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[8][11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[12][13] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[14][15] The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".[10][16] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[14] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[17] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[17] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[12][18] Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.[19]

            Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[20][21] He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[22][23] An awkward and introverted child,[24] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[17][25] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[26]</span>

            <h1>wealth</h1>
            <br>
            <span>Musk made $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002.[238] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[239]

                At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[240] By the year's end his net worth had increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[241] During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[242] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[243] In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[244] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[245] On September 27, 2021, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world, after Tesla stock surged.[246] In November 2021, Musk became the first person with a net worth over $300 billion.[247]
                
                Around three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla.[243] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018 to a compensation plan with the board that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[241] The deal stipulated that Musk only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values.[248] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board.[249] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[249][248]
                
                Musk has repeatedly described himself as "cash poor",[250][251] and has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".[250] In 2012, Musk signed The Giving Pledge and, in May 2020, Musk pledged to "sell almost all physical possessions".[251][252] In 2021, Musk defended his wealth by saying he is "accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary [and] extend the light of consciousness to the stars".[253] In the early 2000s, Musk was a private pilot, his favorite aircraft then being the L-39 Albatros, though he decided to stop piloting by 2008.[254][255] He uses a private jet owned by SpaceX[256][257] and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[258] The jet's heavy use of fossil fuels—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—has received criticism.[256][259] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[260]</span>
